### Hi there, this is Bo Wang (王博) 👋
- I am a PhD in Atmospheric Science program at the [Department of Atmospheric and Earth Science](https://www.uah.edu/science/departments/atmospheric-science) of [The University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/).
- I am studying the tropospheric ozone production from U.S. fires through multi-platform observations and regional transport model. I aim to explain the chemical drivers and dynamical processes affecting the ozone distribution in fire smoke.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
    * [WRF-Chem Integrated Reaction Rates](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem): a diagnostic tool I am using in my research.
